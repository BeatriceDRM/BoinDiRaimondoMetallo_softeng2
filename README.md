# SE4HPCproject

Our project satisfies all the requests correctly. 

Furthermore, we have been able to upload the two files .txt (respectively output.txt and error.txt) using an artifact.
As a result, in txtFilesAction, you can see the two .txt created by the action "Upload the files".
Inside txtFiles, you can see the .txt obtained by copy.

These two folders are both present because, in this way, we were able to make a comparison and to be sure that the result was correct.
